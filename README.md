This project is the first android app I've made without the direction of some type of tutorial

The LightShowApp consists of a grid of circles that the user can select to color either individually or all at once. Then, when the light show start/stop button is clicked, it toggles a light show by turning all circles off and then randomly turning them on and off again.
